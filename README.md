# bamazon

Bamazon is an app created using mySQL workbench and node. When the application is ran, the customer will have a choice of which items they are able to purchase based on the database/table created in mySQL. It will show the item_id, item_name, department_name, price and stock_quantity. The user will be able to choose the amount they want and it should show the total added in the console. If the user inputs a number greater than the stock_quantity available it will return a message saying "oops sorry!".
